A widget that displays event data from the online membership management system <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/admidio/">Admidio</a>.

== Description ==

[Admidio](http://sourceforge.net/projects/admidio/ "Admidio at SourceForge") is a free PHP based membership management system for organizations and groups. It also offers an event manager module to plan date, time and place of events.

**Admidio Events** displays such event data in the widget area of a WordPress page, for example the home page of the sports club the members belong to. The number of upcoming events can be configured. Also the widget offers a collapsed (event name, date) or expanded (all event data) view. The data between Admidio and WordPress is transferred via RSS.
